Chancellor Schröder's labor market reforms, known as Agenda 2010, have sparked controversy and discontent among traditional SPD supporters, leading to internal rifts within the party. Meanwhile, Merkel's CDU, buoyed by promises of economic revitalization and conservative values, has garnered widespread support, capitalizing on dissatisfaction with the status quo. The debate over economic policies, including labor market reforms, taxation, and welfare provisions, is expected to dominate the campaign trail. Additionally, issues such as Germany's role in the European Union, foreign policy, immigration, and national security are poised to take center stage. Merkel's stance on these matters, particularly her calls for closer ties with the United States and a tougher stance on immigration, will contrast sharply with Schröder's policies.</p>"\", \"image_url\": \"https://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/images/7494540.jpg\", \"winning_electoral_vote_number\": 76, \"advisor_url\": \"https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/e/8/e89689a-heusgen-nim-getty.jpg\", \"recommended_reading\": \"<h1>Thank you for playing 2005 Germany!</h1><p>You can try these links for greater understanding of german politics:</p><p><a href=\\\"https://us.boell.org/en/2021/09/14/german-political-and-electoral-system-how-does-it-work/\\\">The political system of Germany</a></p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OnO7uxmJzg\\\">The Political Parties in Germany.</a></p>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/eb/13/bfeb13ded5c0f8e7ab0539a26f4e2c89.jpg\"}}]");

But never before has the party moved so far away from its traditional socialist stance as it did under the Schröder government. Its ever-increasing tendency towards liberal economic policies and cutbacks in government spending on social welfare programs led to a dramatic decline in voter support.
